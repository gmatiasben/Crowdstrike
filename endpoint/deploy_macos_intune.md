# Installing Crowdstrike Falcon Protect for MacOS via Microsoft Intune
Intune doesn't support installing .pkg files directly - instead requiring wrapping them using custom scripts.

It's much easier and more reliable to use a shell script to deploy Crowdstrike Falcon Protect to end-users.

Here's the steps I went through to get it working.

## Step 1 - Deploy configuration profiles
Crowdstrike provides a Configuration profile to enable KExts, System Extensions, Full Disk Access and Web Content Filtering that can be deployed by Intune. Unfortunately this profile does not work on Apple Silicon (M1) devices due to lack of support for KExts.

This would be an easy fix if there was a way to identify arm64 devices in intune for use in Dynamic Groups or the new Filters feature - but so far I haven't figured out a decent way to do this (If you find something, please submit an issue or PR on this repo!).

The closest thing to do to get this to work is to deploy two .mobileconfigs - one with the standalone kexts and one with the rest of the permissions - the kexts will still fail on Apple Silicon, but it doesn't cause any issues with the installation, since Crowdstrike doesn't try to use them on M1.

Deploy the .mobileconfig files in /MobileConfigs by doing the following:

1. Open open the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center
2. Select Devices -> Configuration Profiles
3. Click Create Profile
4. In the blade that opens on the right, select macOS for platform, Templates for Profile type, and Custom for template name. Click Create
5. Enter the basic details for the profile. Click Next
6. Upload profile [MobileConfigs/Falcon Profile.mobileconfig](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/ka16T000000wtMWQAY)
* Check Falcon Configuration Profile for Sonoma and earlier vs Falcon Configuration Profile Update for Sequoia and later
7. Choose the users and/or devices to deploy to
8. Review the settings for your profile, and click Create

## Part 2 - API Client

The CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor can be downloaded using a script directly within the Falcon Console. This can be achieved through an API that can be found by navigating to Support and Resources â†’ API clients and keys. 

* Click on Create API client button.
* * Client name = Deploy MacOS
* * Scope = Sensor download | Read, Falcon images download | Read
* Click on create
* Save client id, secret and Base URL. You will need them for the next step.


## Part 3 - Deployment Script

Now the actual deployment of Crowdstrike - This should work on M1 and Intel with no additional dependencies.

How to push the script via Intune:

1. Open open the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center
2. Select Devices -> Scripts
3. Click + Add
4. Enter the basic details for the script
5. Upload [[CSFalconInstall.sh](https://github.com/cliv/cs-falcon-protect-intune?tab=readme-ov-file#:~:text=Upload-,CSFalconInstall.sh,-Select%20%22No%22%20For)](https://github.com/cliv/cs-falcon-protect-intune/blob/main/CSFalconInstall.sh)
* Update parameters CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and BASE_URL from step (2).
* Select "No" For Run script as signed-in user so it runs as the superuser instead of the local user
* Choose your preference for Hide script notifications on devices
* Setting Not Configured for the Script Frequency will ensure it runs only once (Unless the script is updated or the user's cache is deleted)
* 1 time for script retries should be plenty, but this setting is at your discretion.
6. Select the users and devices you want to deploy Crowdstrike Falcon Protect to
7. Review your settings and click Add if everything looks correct to you
